The practitioners of this discipline are said to be half-in, half-out due to the fact that they seem to be living in two worlds; in fact, this is not far from the truth.\nVeiled Moon disciples have grasped connections to the Astral and Ethereal planes in their mind through intense meditation and a spiritual devotion to learning the ways of spirits and the natural world, and blended them seamlessly into a martial art so supernatural that it borders on the magical. A potent, yet passive, discipline, its esoteric abilities are often misunderstood.\nInitiation Modifier: Dexterity"
