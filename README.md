# Path of War for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous

An attempt at adding the [Path of War](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/path-of-war/) rule system.
Only tested for turn-based.
Liberties have been taken for technical reasons and for ease of implementation, so refer to the in-game descriptions of abilities for accurate information.
All characters will be able to choose a discipline at level 1 and maneuvers and stances as they level up.
Counters have been changed into stances, with once per turn limit when necessary for balance.

## [Disciplines](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/path-of-war/disciplines-and-maneuvers/):
